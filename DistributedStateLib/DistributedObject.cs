    /// <remarks>
    /// The DistributedState framework divides the functionality of a distributed object into two parts:
    /// 
    /// 1) A DistributedObject derived class, which handles message routing from/to proxy objects, and which
    ///    also relays messages to:
    /// 2) A LocalObject derived class, which implements the actual local behavior of the distributed object.
    /// 
    /// The LocalObject derived class implements an interface (derived from IDistributedObject) which presents
    /// all the methods that can be invoked on those objects.
    /// 
    /// The DistributedObject derived class also implements that same interface.  If the DistributedObject is
    /// an owner, it will relay calls as commands to its proxies (as well as to its local object); if the
    /// DistributedObject is a proxy, it will relay the message as a command request to the owner.
    /// If the DistributedObject is a proxy and receives a command from the owner, it relays it to the proxy's
    /// local object.
    /// 
    /// The net result is:
    /// 1) All method invocations on the owner are relayed reliably and in sequence to all proxies.
    /// 2) The owner and all proxies update local state in response to that reliable command sequence, keeping
    ///    all proxies synchronized.
    /// 3) Proxies whose methods are invoked do not update any local state, but only relay command requests to
    ///    the owner; the owner is always authoritative about state.
